# m3uconverter
A silly little program for converting .m3u playlist files from Apple Music to the format needed by the SanDisk Clip family of MP3 players. Compiling and running instructions are at the top of the m3uconverter.cpp file. This program is absolutely free and comes with no warranty. Have fun. Keep jammin.
